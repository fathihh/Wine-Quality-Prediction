🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties using machine learning regression techniques. It demonstrates the complete supervised learning workflow—from data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment.

📌 Overview

The objective of this project is to build and compare multiple regression models that can accurately predict wine quality scores based on chemical characteristics such as acidity, sugar content, pH, alcohol level, and more.

Key Steps Involved

Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Feature selection and correlation analysis

Model training and evaluation
