# Wine-Quality-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on various physicochemical features using machine learning techniques. It was developed to demonstrate supervised learning and model evaluation for regression tasks.
📌 Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates wine quality based on characteristics such as acidity, sugar content, pH, and more.

Key steps in this project include:

Data preprocessing and analysis
Feature selection
Model training and evaluation (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine)
Predicting quality scores and comparing model performance
Saving the trained model using joblib for future reuse
🧪 Dataset
The dataset used is the Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
